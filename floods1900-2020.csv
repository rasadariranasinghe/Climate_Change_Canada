A massive storm system crept through Alberta causing significant flooding throughout the province. As of 2013, this event was responsible for the largest evacuation due to a natural disaster in Alberta‚Äôs history. Beginning in northern Alberta, Fort McMurray declared a local state of emergency when water from the Hanging Stone River breached its banks on June 8. The storm then moved south on June 19, where it remained for three days over southern Alberta. Heavy rain spanning across a region from Canmore to Calgary produced an average of 75 to 150 mm during this three-day period. Twenty-nine local states of emergency were declared throughout the province. Four deaths were attributed to the floods, which caused significant disruptions across the province to power, telecommunications, clean water supply, and transportation corridors, including a section of the Trans-Canada Highway that closed due to a mudslide caused by the torrential rain. In Calgary the Bow and Elbow Rivers flooded, which forced 75,000 residents to evacuate the city. Over 4000 business were affected and 3000 buildings were flooded, including that Saddledome and the Calgary Zoo. The towns of High River and Canmore were also significantly impacted by the floods. In total, flooding forced the evacuations of approximately 100,000 Albertans. As flood conditions improved, some residents were allowed to gradually return to their communities beginning on June 23, while the remaining residents were allowed to return by June 28. Response to the flood was provided by municipal, provincial, and federal governments and non-governmental organizations. Insurance payments are estimated at $1.2 billion. This disaster is estimated to have reduced Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Southern Alberta by $550 million (2013 dollars).",4,0,100000,2715742000,132690977.2,6/28/2013 12:00:00 AM,1015742000,,,,,1700000000,,,

Higher-than-normal snow fall and lower temperatures delayed the annual spring melt until the end of April. Over 15 communities declared states of emergencies between April and June as flood waters rose throughout the province. Overland flooding occurred between Moose Jaw and Indian Head, including parts of Regina and south past Weyburn to the U.S border. Significant damage occurred on parts of Highways 2 and 3 that were washed out by the flood waters. Flood waters flowing east on the South Saskatchewan River from Alberta following the June 19 flash floods reached a peak flow of 6000 cubic metres per second, the highest ever recorded, flowing into the Lake Diefenbaker Reservoir. Between June 23 and 28 the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency began releasing water from the reservoir at a rate of 2000 cubic metres per second, leading to a two-metre rise in the river downstream. As a result, 2,200 residents of Cumberland House were evacuated to Prince Albert and Saskatoon. On July 3, 2013 the evacuation order was lifted and residents began to return to the community.

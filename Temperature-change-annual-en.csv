Note: Annual average temperature departures were computed for weather stations across Canada with sufficiently long data records to allow for trend calculation and were then interpolated to a 50-kilometre spaced grid. Annual grid point values were averaged together to produce an annual time series of temperature departures representing the entire country. Departures are calculated by subtracting the 1961 to 1990 reference value from the annual average.,,
